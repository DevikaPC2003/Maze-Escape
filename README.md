# Maze Escape 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Devika Chettayil's Team


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Devika Chettayil - College of Engineering and Management Punnapra Alappuzha 

### Project Description
Maze Escape is a fast-paced, colorful 2D maze game where players navigate through tricky paths, beat the ticking timer, and rack up points. Designed for fun and challenge, it combines simple controls and multiple levels to keep players hooked.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep getting lost in malls, offices, and parking lots… even in their own houses!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a maze game so you can practice escaping virtually — because obviously, solving a pixel maze will prepare you for real-life parking garages.
